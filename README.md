This was my first web app to get the daily count of Coronavirus accross all the countries and then display the daily as well as cumulative count of Cases, Deaths, Recoveries.etc

The app was built using `create-react-app` which then became my goto method to create apps quickly instead of speading a ton of time on setting up the app from scratch.

The app may lack a bit in styling but my major focus of getting the app up was to provide essential data which could be sorted or displayed based on your requirement. The app also provided the graphical view to get a pattern of how things have been so far and where they could be headed. I did get Ideas about inserting projections of where the numbers are headed but decided against it as this was a serious matter.

I have also written a similar app using pure Javascript functional programming using Functions, React hooks and Redux as opposed to classes and the class based store.

Please do let me know what you think and am open to suggestions/reviews.
